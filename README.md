# Pathfinding-using-A-Algorithm_202401100300174
This Python code implements the A pathfinding algorithm* to find the shortest path on a grid with obstacles. The Node class represents each grid cell, storing position, cost, and parent. The AStar class handles pathfinding, calculating the Manhattan distance as the heuristic. It uses a priority queue (min-heap) to manage nodes, exploring the lowest-cost node first. Neighbors are generated in four directions (up, down, left, right), and obstacles are avoided. The path is reconstructed by tracing parent nodes. The get_user_input function takes grid dimensions, obstacles, start, and end points from the user. The main block executes the algorithm and prints the result.
